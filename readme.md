# This is my Sudoku project. Currently in progress.

Current stage of the project:

I have created an automatic Sudoku puzzle solver based on a Depth-first search, backtracking algorithm. I have also optimized it to reduce computational time as much as possible, although this is still ongoing.

# Next step

Write a program that dig holes in completed Sudoku grids to generate new puzzles based on the desired level of difficulty.
